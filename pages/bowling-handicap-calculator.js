    <h3>Bowling Handicap</h3>

    <p>
      A handicap system is used in various sports to equalize the chance of
      winning for players with different skills. You can read more about

      . In bowling a calculated handicap value is added to the game score to
      adjust the result. The handicap value is based on previous games bowled by
      the player. The lower the average score of previous games the higher the
      handicap value. This way making it possible for players at any level to
      compete in same competitions.

    <h3>Calculating Bowling Handicap</h3>
    <p>
      A bowling handicap is a percentage of the difference between your average
      and a basis average. So for calculating you need to know the used basis
      average and the used percentage factor. You get these from your league or
      tournament officials. If you are not competing in either of those, you can
      decide those values with your competitors. Usual values are 200, 210 or
      220 for basis average and 80%, 90% or 100% for percentage factor. The
      basis average is intended to be more than any individual bowlerâ€™s average.
    </p>

    <p>
      To find out your average add the scores from your previous games and
      divide the result with the number of games. If you are bowling in a league
      you probably must use game scores from league games. Otherwise, once
      again, you can decide the number of games with your competitors. Let's say
      you decided to use three previous games with scores 157, 143 and 142. The
      sum of these is 442 and when you divide it with 3 you get 147.3 pins per
      game. Drop a fraction of a pin and your official average is 147.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subtract your average from the basis score and multiply the result with
      the percentage factor. Let's say that the basis score is 200 and the
      percentage factor is 90%. You get (200-147)x0.9=47.7. Once again drop the
      fraction and your handicap is 47. To get your adjusted score, simply add
      the handicap to your game score. For example if you get 143, your adjusted
      score is 190. Try this out with the bowling handicap calculator above.
